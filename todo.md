need to make it so that when you scroll down, if you reach aound 2/3 of the terminal height, the contents will start to scroll down too.
need to find a better symbol than > for the separator between the program title and theccurrent file path 
if you enter the program by specifying a file path rather than just ./fgot3 and then you navigate back using h, since there is no historic index for the previous depth, it won't have anything highlighted. easy fix.
